# Order Stager Repository

This is a simple body mass index measurer written in Python. I have forked the info used for it and plan on manipulating the code so it can be used for an order stager in a department store. Instead of entering height and weight to receive a BMI score, the user of the code will enter the width and height (potentially weight also) of merchandise purchased by a customer and prompt them where to stage the items so they can be retrieved when the customer arrives to pick them up.
## Usage

1. Install <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python</a>;
2. Run PyBMI.py file.
